# Little Brother



## Introduction

I wrote Little Brother in a white-hot fury between May 7, 2007 and July 2,
2007: exactly eight weeks from the day I thought it up to the day I finished it
(Alice, to whom this book is dedicated, had to put up with me clacking out the
final chapter at 5AM in our hotel in Rome, where we were celebrating our
anniversary). I'd always dreamed of having a book just materialize, fully
formed, and come pouring out of my fingertips, no sweat and fuss -- but it
wasn't nearly as much fun as I'd thought it would be. There were days when
I wrote 10,000 words, hunching over my keyboard in airports, on subways, in
taxis -- anywhere I could type. The book was trying to get out of my head, no
matter what, and I missed so much sleep and so many meals that friends started
to ask if I was unwell.

When my dad was a young university student in the 1960s, he was one of the few
"counterculture" people who thought computers were a good thing. For most young
people, computers represented the de-humanization of society. University
students were reduced to numbers on a punchcard, each bearing the legend "DO
NOT BEND, SPINDLE, FOLD OR MUTILATE," prompting some of the students to wear
pins that said, "I AM A STUDENT: DO NOT BEND, SPINDLE, FOLD OR MUTILATE ME."
Computers were seen as a means to increase the ability of the authorities to
regiment people and bend them to their will.

When I was 17, the world seemed like it was just going to get more free. The
Berlin Wall was about to come down. Computers -- which had been geeky and weird
a few years before -- were everywhere, and the modem I'd used to connect to
local bulletin board systems was now connecting me to the entire world through
the Internet and commercial online services like GEnie. My lifelong fascination
with activist causes went into overdrive as I saw how the main difficulty in
activism -- organizing -- was getting easier by leaps and bounds (I still
remember the first time I switched from mailing out a newsletter with
hand-written addresses to using a database with mail-merge). In the Soviet
Union, communications tools were being used to bring information -- and
revolution -- to the farthest-flung corners of the largest authoritarian state
the Earth had ever seen.

But 17 years later, things are very different. The computers I love are being
co-opted, used to spy on us, control us, snitch on us. The National Security
Agency has illegally wiretapped the entire USA and gotten away with it. Car
rental companies and mass transit and traffic authorities are watching where we
go, sending us automated tickets, finking us out to busybodies, cops and bad
guys who gain illicit access to their databases. The Transport Security
Administration maintains a "no-fly" list of people who'd never been convicted
of any crime, but who are nevertheless considered too dangerous to fly. The
list's contents are secret. The rule that makes it enforceable is secret. The
criteria for being added to the list are secret. It has four-year-olds on it.
And US senators. And decorated veterans -- actual war heroes.

The 17 year olds I know understand to a nicety just how dangerous a computer
can be. The authoritarian nightmare of the 1960s has come home for them. The
seductive little boxes on their desks and in their pockets watch their every
move, corral them in, systematically depriving them of those new freedoms I had
enjoyed and made such good use of in my young adulthood.

What's more, kids were clearly being used as guinea-pigs for a new kind of
technological state that all of us were on our way to, a world where taking
a picture was either piracy (in a movie theater or museum or even a Starbucks),
or terrorism (in a public place), but where we could be photographed, tracked
and logged hundreds of times a day by every tin-pot dictator, cop, bureaucrat
and shop-keeper. A world where any measure, including torture, could be
justified just by waving your hands and shouting "Terrorism! 9/11! Terrorism!"
until all dissent fell silent.

We don't have to go down that road.

If you love freedom, if you think the human condition is dignified by privacy,
by the right to be left alone, by the right to explore your weird ideas
provided you don't hurt others, then you have common cause with the kids whose
web-browsers and cell phones are being used to lock them up and follow them
around.

If you believe that the answer to bad speech is more speech -- not censorship
-- then you have a dog in the fight.

If you believe in a society of laws, a land where our rulers have to tell us
the rules, and have to follow them too, then you're part of the same struggle
that kids fight when they argue for the right to live under the same Bill of
Rights that adults have.

This book is meant to be part of the conversation about what an information
society means: does it mean total control, or unheard-of liberty? It's not just
a noun, it's a verb, it's something you do.



### Do Something

This book is meant to be something you do, not just something you read.
The technology in this book is either real or nearly real. You can build
a lot of it. You can share it and remix it (see THE COPYRIGHT THING,
below). You can use the ideas to spark important discussions with your
friends and family. You can use those ideas to defeat censorship and get
onto the free Internet, even if your government, employer or school
doesn't want you to.

Making stuff: The folks at Instructables have put up some killer HOWTOs
for building the technology in this book. It's easy and incredibly fun.
There's nothing so rewarding in this world as making stuff, especially
stuff that makes you more free:
http://www.instructables.com/member/w1n5t0n/

Discussions: There's an [educator's manual for this book](http://www.tor-forge.com/static/Little_Brother_Readers_Guide.pdf) that my publisher,
Tor, has put together that has tons of ideas for classroom, reading group
and home discussions of the ideas in it.

Defeat censorship: The afterword for this book has lots of resources for
increasing your online freedom, blocking the snoops and evading the
censorware blocks. The more people who know about this stuff, the better.

Your stories: I'm collecting stories of people who've used technology to
get the upper hand when confronted with abusive authority. I'm going to be
including the best of these in a special afterword to the UK edition (see
below) of the book, and I'll be putting them online as well. Send me your
stories at [doctorow@craphound.com, with the subject line "Abuses of
Authority"](doctorow@craphound.com&subject=Abuses of Authority).


### Great Britain

I'm a Canadian, and I've lived in lots of places (including San Francisco,
the setting for Little Brother), and now I live in London, England, with
my wife Alice and our little daughter, Poesy. I've lived here (off and on)
for five years now, and though I love it to tiny pieces, there's one thing
that's always bugged me: my books aren't available here. Some stores
carried them as special items, imported from the USA, but it wasn't
published by a British publisher.

That's changed! HarperCollins UK has bought the British rights to this
book (along with my next young adult novel, FOR THE WIN), and they're
publishing it just a few months after the US edition, on November 17, 2008
(the day after I get back from my honeymoon!).

Update, November 27, 2008: And it's on shelves now! The HarperCollins
edition's a knockout, too!

I'm so glad about this, I could bust, honestly. Not just because they're
finally selling my books in my adopted homeland, but because I'm raising
a daughter here, dammit, and the surveillance and control mania in this
country is starting to scare me bloodless. It seems like the entire police
and governance system in Britain has fallen in love with DNA-swabbing,
fingerprinting and video-recording everyone, on the off chance that
someday you might do something wrong. In early 2008, the head of Scotland
Yard seriously proposed taking DNA from five-year-olds who display
"offending traits" because they'll probably grow up to be criminals. The
next week, the London police put up posters asking us all to turn in
people who seem to be taking pictures of the ubiquitous CCTV spy-cameras
because anyone who pays too much attention to the surveillance machine is
probably a terrorist.

America isn't the only country that lost its mind this decade. Britain's
right there in the nuthouse with it, dribbling down its shirt front and
pointing its finger at the invisible bogeymen and screaming until it gets
its meds.

We need to be having this conversation all over the planet.

### Other Edition

My agent, Russell Galen (and his sub-agent Danny Baror) did an amazing job
of pre-selling rights to Little Brother in many languages and formats.

A condition of my deal with Random House is that they're not allowed to
release this on services that use "DRM" (Digital Rights Management)
systems intended to control use and copying. That means that you won't
find this book on Audible or iTunes, because Audible refuses to sell books
without DRM (even if the author and publisher don't want DRM), and iTunes
only carries Audible audiobooks. However, you can buy the MP3 file direct
from RandomHouse or many other fine etailers, or through this link My
foreign rights agent, Danny Baror, has presold a number of foreign
editions:

  * Greece: Pataki 
  * Russia: AST Publishing 
  * France: Universe Poche 
  * Norway: Det Norske Samlaget 

No publication dates yet for these, but I'll keep updating this file as
more information is available. You can also subscribe to my mailing list
for more info.



### The Copyright Thing

The Creative Commons license at the top of this file probably tipped you
off to the fact that I've got some pretty unorthodox views about
copyright. Here's what I think of it, in a nutshell: a little goes a long
way, and more than that is too much.

I like the fact that copyright lets me sell rights to my publishers and
film studios and so on. It's nice that they can't just take my stuff
without permission and get rich on it without cutting me in for a piece of
the action. I'm in a pretty good position when it comes to negotiating
with these companies: I've got a great agent and a decade's experience
with copyright law and licensing (including a stint as a delegate at WIPO,
the UN agency that makes the world's copyright treaties). What's more,
there's just not that many of these negotiations -- even if I sell fifty
or a hundred different editions of Little Brother (which would put it in
top millionth of a percentile for fiction), that's still only a hundred
negotiations, which I could just about manage.

I hate the fact that fans who want to do what readers have always done are
expected to play in the same system as all these hotshot agents and
lawyers. It's just stupid to say that an elementary school classroom
should have to talk to a lawyer at a giant global publisher before they
put on a play based on one of my books. It's ridiculous to say that people
who want to "loan" their electronic copy of my book to a friend need to
get a license to do so. Loaning books has been around longer than any
publisher on Earth, and it's a fine thing.

I recently saw Neil Gaiman give a talk at which someone asked him how he
felt about piracy of his books. He said, "Hands up in the audience if you
discovered your favorite writer for free -- because someone loaned you
a copy, or because someone gave it to you? Now, hands up if you found your
favorite writer by walking into a store and plunking down cash."
Overwhelmingly, the audience said that they'd discovered their favorite
writers for free, on a loan or as a gift. When it comes to my favorite
writers, there's no boundaries: I'll buy every book they publish, just to
own it (sometimes I buy two or three, to give away to friends who must
read those books). I pay to see them live. I buy t-shirts with their
book-covers on them. I'm a customer for life.

Neil went on to say that he was part of the tribe of readers, the tiny
minority of people in the world who read for pleasure, buying books
because they love them. One thing he knows about everyone who downloads
his books on the Internet without permission is that they're readers,
they're people who love books.

People who study the habits of music-buyers have discovered something
curious: the biggest pirates are also the biggest spenders. If you pirate
music all night long, chances are you're one of the few people left who
also goes to the record store (remember those?) during the day. You
probably go to concerts on the weekend, and you probably check music out
of the library too. If you're a member of the red-hot music-fan tribe, you
do lots of everything that has to do with music, from singing in the
shower to paying for black-market vinyl bootlegs of rare Eastern European
covers of your favorite death-metal band.

Same with books. I've worked in new bookstores, used bookstores and
libraries. I've hung out in pirate ebook ("bookwarez") places online. I'm
a stone used bookstore junkie, and I go to book fairs for fun. And you
know what? It's the same people at all those places: book fans who do lots
of everything that has to do with books. I buy weird, fugly pirate
editions of my favorite books in China because they're weird and fugly and
look great next to the eight or nine other editions that I paid
full-freight for of the same books. I check books out of the library,
google them when I need a quote, carry dozens around on my phone and
hundreds on my laptop, and have (at this writing) more than 10,000 of them
in storage lockers in London, Los Angeles and Toronto.

If I could loan out my physical books without giving up possession of
them, I would. The fact that I can do so with digital files is not a bug,
it's a feature, and a damned fine one. It's embarrassing to see all these
writers and musicians and artists bemoaning the fact that art just got
this wicked new feature: the ability to be shared without losing access to
it in the first place. It's like watching restaurant owners crying down
their shirts about the new free lunch machine that's feeding the world's
starving people because it'll force them to reconsider their
business-models. Yes, that's gonna be tricky, but let's not lose sight of
the main attraction: free lunches!

Universal access to human knowledge is in our grasp, for the first time in
the history of the world. This is not a bad thing.

In case that's not enough for you, here's my pitch on why giving away
ebooks makes sense at this time and place:

Giving away ebooks gives me artistic, moral and commercial satisfaction.
The commercial question is the one that comes up most often: how can you
give away free ebooks and still make money?

For me -- for pretty much every writer -- the big problem isn't piracy,
it's obscurity (thanks to Tim O'Reilly for this great aphorism). Of all
the people who failed to buy this book today, the majority did so because
they never heard of it, not because someone gave them a free copy.
Mega-hit best-sellers in science fiction sell half a million copies -- in
a world where 175,000 attend the San Diego Comic Con alone, you've got to
figure that most of the people who "like science fiction" (and related
geeky stuff like comics, games, Linux, and so on) just don't really buy
books. I'm more interested in getting more of that wider audience into the
tent than making sure that everyone who's in the tent bought a ticket to
be there.

Ebooks are verbs, not nouns. You copy them, it's in their nature. And many
of those copies have a destination, a person they're intended for,
a hand-wrought transfer from one person to another, embodying a personal
recommendation between two people who trust each other enough to share
bits. That's the kind of thing that authors (should) dream of, the
proverbial sealing of the deal. By making my books available for free
pass-along, I make it easy for people who love them to help other people
love them.

What's more, I don't see ebooks as substitute for paper books for most
people. It's not that the screens aren't good enough, either: if you're
anything like me, you already spend every hour you can get in front of the
screen, reading text. But the more computer-literate you are, the less
likely you are to be reading long-form works on those screens -- that's
because computer-literate people do more things with their computers. We
run IM and email and we use the browser in a million diverse ways. We have
games running in the background, and endless opportunities to tinker with
our music libraries. The more you do with your computer, the more likely
it is that you'll be interrupted after five to seven minutes to do
something else. That makes the computer extremely poorly suited to reading
long-form works off of, unless you have the iron self-discipline of
a monk.

The good news (for writers) is that this means that ebooks on computers
are more likely to be an enticement to buy the printed book (which is,
after all, cheap, easily had, and easy to use) than a substitute for it.
You can probably read just enough of the book off the screen to realize
you want to be reading it on paper.

So ebooks sell print books. Every writer I've heard of who's tried giving
away ebooks to promote paper books has come back to do it again. That's
the commercial case for doing free ebooks.

Now, onto the artistic case. It's the twenty-first century. Copying stuff
is never, ever going to get any harder than it is today (or if it does,
it'll be because civilization has collapsed, at which point we'll have
other problems). Hard drives aren't going to get bulkier, more expensive,
or less capacious. Networks won't get slower or harder to access. If
you're not making art with the intention of having it copied, you're not
really making art for the twenty-first century. There's something charming
about making work you don't want to be copied, in the same way that it's
nice to go to a Pioneer Village and see the olde-timey blacksmith shoeing
a horse at his traditional forge. But it's hardly, you know, contemporary.
I'm a science fiction writer. It's my job to write about the future (on
a good day) or at least the present. Art that's not supposed to be copied
is from the past.

Finally, let's look at the moral case. Copying stuff is natural. It's how
we learn (copying our parents and the people around us). My first story,
written when I was six, was an excited re-telling of Star Wars, which I'd
just seen in the theater. Now that the Internet -- the world's most
efficient copying machine -- is pretty much everywhere, our copying
instinct is just going to play out more and more. There's no way I can
stop my readers, and if I tried, I'd be a hypocrite: when I was 17, I was
making mix-tapes, photocopying stories, and generally copying in every way
I could imagine. If the Internet had been around then, I'd have been using
it to copy as much as I possibly could.

There's no way to stop it, and the people who try end up doing more harm
than piracy ever did. The record industry's ridiculous holy war against
file-sharers (more than 20,000 music fans sued and counting!) exemplifies
the absurdity of trying to get the food-coloring out of the swimming pool.
If the choice is between allowing copying or being a frothing bully
lashing out at anything he can reach, I choose the former.


### Donations and a Word to Teachers

Every time I put a book online for free, I get emails from readers who
want to send me donations for the book. I appreciate their generous
spirit, but I'm not interested in cash donations, because my publishers
are really important to me. They contribute immeasurably to the book,
improving it, introducing it to an audience I could never reach, helping
me do more with my work. I have no desire to cut them out of the loop.

But there has to be some good way to turn that generosity to good use, and
I think I've found it.

Here's the deal: there are lots of teachers and librarians who'd love to
get hard-copies of this book into their kids' hands, but don't have the
budget for it (teachers in the US spend around $1,200 out of pocket each
on classroom supplies that their budgets won't stretch to cover, which is
why I sponsor a classroom at Ivanhoe Elementary in my old neighborhood in
Los Angeles; you can adopt a class yourself here).

There are generous people who want to send some cash my way to thank me
for the free ebooks.

I'm proposing that we put them together.

If you're a teacher or librarian and you want a free copy of Little
Brother, email freelittlebrother@gmail.com with your name and the name and
address of your school. It'll be posted to my site by my fantastic helper,
Olga Nunes, so that potential donors can see it.

If you enjoyed the electronic edition of Little Brother and you want to
donate something to say thanks, go here and find a teacher or librarian
you want to support. Then go to Amazon, BN.com, or your favorite
electronic bookseller and order a copy to the classroom, then email a copy
of the receipt (feel free to delete your address and other personal info
first!) to freelittlebrother@gmail.com so that Olga can mark that copy as
sent. If you don't want to be publicly acknowledged for your generosity,
let us know and we'll keep you anonymous, otherwise we'll thank you on the
donate page.

I have no idea if this will end up with hundreds, dozens or just a few
copies going out -- but I have high hopes!


## Dedication

## quotes

*A rousing tale of techno-geek rebellion, as necessary and dangerous as file sharing, free speech, and bottled water on a plane.*

- Scott Westerfeld, author of UGLIES and EXTRAS


*I can talk about Little Brother in terms of its bravura political speculation or its brilliant uses of technology -- each of which make this book a must-read -- but, at the end of it all, I'm haunted by the universality of Marcus's rite-of-passage and struggle, an experience any teen today is going to grasp: the moment when you choose what your life will mean and how to achieve it.*

- Steven C Gould, author of JUMPER and REFLEX


*I'd recommend Little Brother over pretty much any book I've read this year, and I'd want to get it into the hands of as many smart 13 year olds, male and female, as I can.*

*Because I think it'll change lives. Because some kids, maybe just a few, won't be the same after they've read it. Maybe they'll change politically, maybe technologically. Maybe it'll just be the first book they loved or that spoke to their inner geek. Maybe they'll want to argue about it and disagree with it. Maybe they'll want to open their computer and see what's in there. I don't know. It made me want to be 13 again right now and reading it for the first time, and then go out and make the world better or stranger or odder. It's a wonderful, important book, in a way that renders its flaws pretty much meaningless.*

- Neil Gaiman, author of ANANSI BOYS


*Little Brother is a scarily realistic adventure about how homeland security technology could be abused to wrongfully imprison innocent Americans. A teenage hacker-turned-hero pits himself against the government to fight for his basic freedoms. This book is action-packed with tales of courage, technology, and demonstrations of digital disobedience as the technophile's civil protest."*

- Bunnie Huang, author of HACKING THE XBOX


*Cory Doctorow is a fast and furious storyteller who gets all the details of alternate reality gaming right, while offering a startling, new vision of how these games might play out in the high-stakes context of a terrorist attack. Little Brother is a brilliant novel with a bold argument: hackers and gamers might just be our country's best hope for the future.*

- Jane McGonical, Designer, I Love Bees


*The right book at the right time from the right author -- and, not entirely coincidentally, Cory Doctorow's best novel yet.*

- John Scalzi, author of OLD MAN'S WAR


*It's about growing up in the near future where things have kept going on the way they've been going, and it's about hacking as a habit of mind, but mostly it's about growing up and changing and looking at the world and asking what you can do about that. The teenage voice is pitch-perfect. I couldn't put it down, and I loved it.*

- Jo Walton, author of FARTHING


*A worthy younger sibling to Orwell's 1984, Cory Doctorow's LITTLE BROTHER is lively, precocious, and most importantly, a little scary.*

- Brian K Vaughn, author of Y: THE LAST MAN


*"Little Brother" sounds an optimistic warning. It extrapolates from current events to remind us of the ever-growing threats to liberty. But it also notes that liberty ultimately resides in our individual attitudes and actions. In our increasingly authoritarian world, I especially hope that teenagers and young adults will read it -- and then persuade their peers, parents and teachers to follow suit.*

- Dan Gillmor, author of WE, THE MEDIA



## Chapter 1

This chapter is dedicated to BakkaPhoenix Books in Toronto, Canada. Bakka is the oldest
science fiction bookstore in the world, and it made me the mutant I am today. I wandered 
in for the first time around the age of 10 and asked for some recommendations. Tanya Huff 
(yes, the Tanya Huff, but she wasn't a famous writer back then!) took me back into the 
used section and pressed a copy of H. Beam Piper's "Little Fuzzy" into my hands, and 
changed my life forever. By the time I was 18, I was working at Bakka -- I took over from 
Tanya when she retired to write full time -- and I learned life-long lessons about how 
and why people buy books. I think every writer should work at a bookstore (and plenty of 
writers have worked at Bakka over the years! For the 30th anniversary of the store, they 
put together an anthology of stories by Bakka writers that included work by Michelle 
Sagara (AKA Michelle West), Tanya Huff, Nalo Hopkinson, Tara Tallan --and me!)

I'm a senior at Cesar Chavez high in San Francisco's sunny Mission district, and that 
makes me one of the most surveilled people in the world. My name is Marcus Yallow, but 
back when this story starts, I was going by w1n5t0n. Pronounced "Winston."

Not pronounced "Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn" -- unless you're a clueless 
disciplinary officer who's far enough behind the curve that you still call the Internet 
"the information superhighway."

I know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson, one of three 
vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He's a sucking chest wound of a human being. But if 
you're going to have a jailer, better a clueless one than one who's really on the ball.

"Marcus Yallow," he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA isn't very good to begin 
with, and when you combine that with Benson's habitual mumble, you get something that 
sounds more like someone struggling to digest a bad burrito than a school announcement. 
But human beings are good at picking their names out of audio confusion -- it's a 
survival trait.

I grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut -- I didn't want to blow my 
downloads -- and got ready for the inevitable.

"Report to the administration office immediately."

My social studies teacher, Ms Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and I rolled my eyes back at 
her. The Man was always coming down on me, just because I go through school firewalls 
like wet kleenex, spoof the gait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they 
track us with. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me (especially 
when I'm helping get with her webmail so she can talk to her brother who's stationed in 
Iraq).

My boy Darryl gave me a smack on the ass as I walked past. I've known Darryl since we 
were still in diapers and escaping from play-school, and I've been getting him into and 
out of trouble the whole time. I raised my arms over my head like a prizefighter and 
made my exit from Social Studies and began the perp-walk to the office.

I was halfway there when my phone went. That was another no-no -- phones are muy 
prohibido at Chavez High -- but why should that stop me? I ducked into the toilet and 
shut myself in the middle stall (the furthest stall is always grossest because so many 
people head straight for it, hoping to escape the smell and the squick -- the smart 
money and good hygiene is down the middle). I checked the phone -- my home PC had sent 
it an email to tell it that there was something new up on Harajuku Fun Madness, which 
happens to be the best game ever invented.

I grinned. Spending Fridays at school was teh suck anyway, and I was glad of the excuse 
to make my escape.

I ambled the rest of the way to Benson's office and tossed him a wave as I sailed 
through the door.



"If it isn't Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn," he said. Fredrick Benson -- Social 
Security number 545-03-2343, date of birth August 15 1962, mother's maiden name Di Bona, 
hometown Petaluma -- is a lot taller than me. I'm a runty 5'8", while he stands 6'7", 
and his college basketball days are far enough behind him that his chest muscles have 
turned into saggy man-boobs that were painfully obvious through his freebie dot-com 
polo-shirts. He always looks like he's about to slam-dunk your ass, and he's really into 
raising his voice for dramatic effect. Both these start to lose their efficacy with 
repeated application.

"Sorry, nope," I said. "I never heard of this R2D2 character of yours."

"W1n5t0n," he said, spelling it out again. He gave me a hairy eyeball and waited for me 
to wilt. Of course it was my handle, and had been for years. It was the identity I used 
when I was posting on message-boards where I was making my contributions to the field of 
applied security research. You know, like sneaking out of school and disabling the 
minder-tracer on my phone. But he didn't know that this was my handle. Only a small 
number of people did, and I trusted them all to the end of the earth.

"Um, not ringing any bells," I said. I'd done some pretty cool stuff around school using 
that handle -- I was very proud of my work on snitch-tag killers -- and if he could link 
the two identities, I'd be in trouble. No one at school ever called me w1n5t0n or even 
Winston. Not even my pals. It was Marcus or nothing.

Benson settled down behind his desk and tapped his class-ring nervously on his blotter. 
He did this whenever things started to go bad for him. Poker players call stuff like 
this a "tell" -- something that let you know what was going on in the other guy's head. 
I knew Benson's tells backwards and forwards.

"Marcus, I hope you realize how serious this is."

"I will just as soon as you explain what this is, sir." I always say "sir" to authority 
figures when I'm messing with them. It's my own tell.

He shook his head at me and looked down, another tell. Any second now, he was going to 
start shouting at me. "Listen, kiddo! It's time you came to grips with the fact that we 
know about what you've been doing, and that we're not going to be lenient about it. 
You're going to be lucky if you're not expelled before this meeting is through. Do you 
want to graduate?"

"Mr Benson, you still haven't explained what the problem is --"

He slammed his hand down on the desk and then pointed his finger at me. "The problem, Mr 
Yallow, is that you've been engaged in criminal conspiracy to subvert this school's 
security system, and you have supplied security countermeasures to your fellow students. 
You know that we expelled Graciella Uriarte last week for using one of your devices." 
Uriarte had gotten a bad rap. She'd bought a radio-jammer from a head-shop near the 16th 
Street BART station and it had set off the countermeasures in the school hallway. Not my 
doing, but I felt for her.

"And you think I'm involved in that?"

"We have reliable intelligence indicating that you are w1n5t0n" -- again, he spelled it 
out, and I began to wonder if he hadn't figured out that the 1 was an I and the 5 was an 
S. "We know that this w1n5t0n character is responsible for the theft of last year's 
standardized tests." That actually hadn't been me, but it was a sweet hack, and it was 
kind of flattering to hear it attributed to me. "And therefore liable for several years 
in prison unless you cooperate with me."

"You have 'reliable intelligence'? I'd like to see it."

He glowered at me. "Your attitude isn't going to help you."

"If there's evidence, sir, I think you should call the police and turn it over to them. 
It sounds like this is a very serious matter, and I wouldn't want to stand in the way of 
a proper investigation by the duly constituted authorities."

"You want me to call the police."

"And my parents, I think. That would be for the best."

We stared at each other across the desk. He'd clearly expected me to fold the second he 
dropped the bomb on me. I don't fold. I have a trick for staring down people like 
Benson. I look slightly to the left of their heads, and think about the lyrics to old 
Irish folk songs, the kinds with three hundred verses. It makes me look perfectly 
composed and unworried.

And the wing was on the bird and the bird was on the egg and the egg was in the nest and 
the nest was on the leaf and the leaf was on the twig and the twig was on the branch and 
the branch was on the limb and the limb was in the tree and the tree was in the bog -- 
the bog down in the valley-oh! High-ho the rattlin' bog, the bog down in the valley-oh --

"You can return to class now," he said. "I'll call on you once the police are ready to 
speak to you."

"Are you going to call them now?"

"The procedure for calling in the police is complicated. I'd hoped that we could settle 
this fairly and quickly, but since you insist --"

"I can wait while you call them is all," I said. "I don't mind."

He tapped his ring again and I braced for the blast.

"Go!" he yelled. "Get the hell out of my office, you miserable little --"

I got out, keeping my expression neutral. He wasn't going to call the cops. If he'd had 
enough evidence to go to the police with, he would have called them in the first place. 
He hated my guts. I figured he'd heard some unverified gossip and hoped to spook me into 
confirming it.

I moved down the corridor lightly and sprightly, keeping my gait even and measured for 
the gait-recognition cameras. These had been installed only a year before, and I loved 
them for their sheer idiocy. Beforehand, we'd had face-recognition cameras covering 
nearly every public space in school, but a court ruled that was unconstitutional. So 
Benson and a lot of other paranoid school administrators had spent our textbook dollars 
on these idiot cameras that were supposed to be able to tell one person's walk from 
another. Yeah, right.


I got back to class and sat down again, Ms Galvez warmly welcoming me back. I unpacked 
the school's standard-issue machine and got back into classroom mode. The SchoolBooks 
were the snitchiest technology of them all, logging every keystroke, watching all the 
network traffic for suspicious keywords, counting every click, keeping track of every 
fleeting thought you put out over the net. We'd gotten them in my junior year, and it 
only took a couple months for the shininess to wear off. Once people figured out that 
these "free" laptops worked for the man -- and showed a never-ending parade of obnoxious 
ads to boot -- they suddenly started to feel very heavy and burdensome.

Cracking my SchoolBook had been easy. The crack was online within a month of the machine 
showing up, and there was nothing to it -- just download a DVD image, burn it, stick it 
in the SchoolBook, and boot it while holding down a bunch of different keys at the same 
time. The DVD did the rest, installing a whole bunch of hidden programs on the machine, 
programs that would stay hidden even when the Board of Ed did its daily remote integrity 
checks of the machines. Every now and again I had to get an update for the software to 
get around the Board's latest tests, but it was a small price to pay to get a little 
control over the box.

I fired up IMParanoid, the secret instant messenger that I used when I wanted to have an 
off-the-record discussion right in the middle of class. Darryl was already logged in.

> The game's afoot! Something big is going down with Harajuku Fun Madness, dude. You in?
> No. Freaking. Way. If I get caught ditching a third time, I'm expelled. Man, you know 
that. We'll go after school.
> You've got lunch and then study-hall, right? That's two hours. Plenty of time to run 
down this clue and get back before anyone misses us. I'll get the whole team out.

Harajuku Fun Madness is the best game ever made. I know I already said that, but it 
bears repeating. It's an ARG, an Alternate Reality Game, and the story goes that a gang 
of Japanese fashion-teens discovered a miraculous healing gem at the temple in Harajuku, 
which is basically where cool Japanese teenagers invented every major subculture for the 
past ten years. They're being hunted by evil monks, the Yakuza (AKA the Japanese mafia), 
aliens, tax-inspectors, parents, and a rogue artificial intelligence. They slip the 
players coded messages that we have to decode and use to track down clues that lead to 
more coded messages and more clues.

Imagine the best afternoon you've ever spent prowling the streets of a city, checking 
out all the weird people, funny hand-bills, street-maniacs, and funky shops. Now add a 
scavenger hunt to that, one that requires you to research crazy old films and songs and 
teen culture from around the world and across time and space. And it's a competition, 
with the winning team of four taking a grand prize of ten days in Tokyo, chilling on 
Harajuku bridge, geeking out in Akihabara, and taking home all the Astro Boy merchandise 
you can eat. Except that he's called "Atom Boy" in Japan.

That's Harajuku Fun Madness, and once you've solved a puzzle or two, you'll never look 
back.

> No man, just no. NO. Don't even ask.
> I need you D. You're the best I've got. I swear I'll get us in and out without anyone 
knowing it. You know I can do that, right?
> I know you can do it
> So you're in?
> Hell no
> Come on, Darryl. You're not going to your deathbed wishing you'd spent more study 
periods sitting in school
> I'm not going to go to my deathbed wishing I'd spent more time playing ARGs either
> Yeah but don't you think you might go to your death-bed wishing you'd spent more time 
with Vanessa Pak?
Van was part of my team. She went to a private girl's school in the East Bay, but I knew 
she'd ditch to come out and run the mission with me. Darryl has had a crush on her 
literally for years -- even before puberty endowed her with many lavish gifts. Darryl 
had fallen in love with her mind. Sad, really.

> You suck
> You're coming?
He looked at me and shook his head. Then he nodded. I winked at him and set to work 
getting in touch with the rest of my team.


I wasn't always into ARGing. I have a dark secret: I used to be a LARPer. LARPing is 
Live Action Role Playing, and it's just about what it sounds like: running around in 
costume, talking in a funny accent, pretending to be a super-spy or a vampire or a 
medieval knight. It's like Capture the Flag in monster-drag, with a bit of Drama Club 
thrown in, and the best games were the ones we played in Scout Camps out of town in 
Sonoma or down on the Peninsula. Those three-day epics could get pretty hairy, with 
all-day hikes, epic battles with foam-and-bamboo swords, casting spells by throwing 
beanbags and shouting "Fireball!" and so on. Good fun, if a little goofy. Not nearly as 
geeky as talking about what your elf planned on doing as you sat around a table loaded 
with Diet Coke cans and painted miniatures, and more physically active than going into a 
mouse-coma in front of a massively multiplayer game at home.

The thing that got me into trouble were the mini-games in the hotels. Whenever a science 
fiction convention came to town, some LARPer would convince them to let us run a couple 
of six-hour mini-games at the con, piggybacking on their rental of the space. Having a 
bunch of enthusiastic kids running around in costume lent color to the event, and we got 
to have a ball among people even more socially deviant than us.

The problem with hotels is that they have a lot of non-gamers in them, too -- and not 
just sci-fi people. Normal people. From states that begin and end with vowels. On 
holidays.

And sometimes those people misunderstand the nature of a game.

Let's just leave it at that, OK?


"Gait" is a fancy word for the way you walk. People are pretty good at spotting gaits -- 
next time you're on a camping trip, check out the bobbing of the flashlight as a distant 
friend approaches you. Chances are you can identify him just from the movement of the 
light, the characteristic way it bobs up and down that tells our monkey brains that this 
is a person approaching us.

Gait recognition software takes pictures of your motion, tries to isolate you in the 
pics as a silhouette, and then tries to match the silhouette to a database to see if it 
knows who you are. It's a biometric identifier, like fingerprints or retina-scans, but 
it's got a lot more "collisions" than either of those. A biometric "collision" is when a 
measurement matches more than one person. Only you have your fingerprint, but you share 
your gait with plenty other people.

Not exactly, of course. Your personal, inch-by-inch walk is yours and yours alone. The 
problem is your inch-by-inch walk changes based on how tired you are, what the floor is 
made of, whether you pulled your ankle playing basketball, and whether you've changed 
your shoes lately. So the system kind of fuzzes-out your profile, looking for people who 
walk kind of like you.

There are a lot of people who walk kind of like you. What's more, it's easy not to walk 
kind of like you -- just take one shoe off. Of course, you'll always walk like 
you-with-one-shoe-off in that case, so the cameras will eventually figure out that it's 
still you. Which is why I prefer to inject a little randomness into my attacks on 
gait-recognition: I put a handful of gravel into each shoe. Cheap and effective, and no 
two steps are the same. Plus you get a great reflexology foot massage in the process (I 
kid. Reflexology is about as scientifically useful as gait-recognition).

The cameras used to set off an alert every time someone they didn't recognize stepped 
onto campus.

This did not work.

The alarm went off every ten minutes. When the mailman came by. When a parent dropped 
in. When the grounds-people went to work fixing up the basketball court. When a student 
showed up wearing new shoes.

So now it just tries to keep track of who's where and when. If someone leaves by the 
school-gates during classes, their gait is checked to see if it kinda-sorta matches any 
student gait and if it does, whoop-whoop-whoop, ring the alarm!


Class ended in ten minutes, and that didn't leave me with much time to prepare. The 
first order of business were those pesky gait-recognition cameras. Like I said, they'd 
started out as face-recognition cameras, but those had been ruled unconstitutional. As 
far as I know, no court has yet determined whether these gait-cams are any more legal, 
but until they do, we're stuck with them.



Now I had an indie browser running, I needed an indie network connection. The school's 
network logged every click in and out of the system, which was bad news if you were 
planning on surfing over to the Harajuku Fun Madness site for some extra-curricular fun.

The answer is something ingenious called TOR -- The Onion Router. An onion router is an 
Internet site that takes requests for web-pages and passes them onto other onion 
routers, and on to other onion routers, until one of them finally decides to fetch the 
page and pass it back through the layers of the onion until it reaches you. The traffic 
to the onion-routers is encrypted, which means that the school can't see what you're 
asking for, and the layers of the onion don't know who they're working for. There are 
millions of nodes -- the program was set up by the US Office of Naval Research to help 
their people get around the censorware in countries like Syria and China, which means 
that it's perfectly designed for operating in the confines of an average American high 
school.

TOR works because the school has a finite blacklist of naughty addresses we aren't 
allowed to visit, and the addresses of the nodes change all the time -- no way could the 
school keep track of them all. Firefox and TOR together made me into the invisible man, 
impervious to Board of Ed snooping, free to check out the Harajuku FM site and see what 
was up.

There it was, a new clue. Like all Harajuku Fun Madness clues, it had a physical, online 
and mental component. The online component was a puzzle you had to solve, one that 
required you to research the answers to a bunch of obscure questions. This batch 
included a bunch of questions on the plots in dojinshi -- those are comic books drawn by 
fans of manga, Japanese comics. They can be as big as the official comics that inspire 
them, but they're a lot weirder, with crossover story-lines and sometimes really silly 
songs and action. Lots of love stories, of course. Everyone loves to see their favorite 
toons hook up.

I'd have to solve those riddles later, when I got home. They were easiest to solve with 
the whole team, downloading tons of dojinshi files and scouring them for answers to the 
puzzles.

I'd just finished scrap-booking all the clues when the bell rang and we began our 
escape. I surreptitiously slid the gravel down the side of my short boots -- ankle-high 
Blundstones from Australia, great for running and climbing, and the easy 
slip-on/slip-off laceless design makes them convenient at the never-ending 
metal-detectors that are everywhere now.

We also had to evade physical surveillance, of course, but that gets easier every time 
they add a new layer of physical snoopery -- all the bells and whistles lull our beloved 
faculty into a totally false sense of security. We surfed the crowd down the hallways, 
heading for my favorite side-exit. We were halfway along when Darryl hissed, "Crap! I 
forgot, I've got a library book in my bag."

"You're kidding me," I said, and hauled him into the next bathroom we passed. Library 
books are bad news. Every one of them has an arphid -- Radio Frequency ID tag -- glued 
into its binding, which makes it possible for the librarians to check out the books by 
waving them over a reader, and lets a library shelf tell you if any of the books on it 
are out of place.

But it also lets the school track where you are at all times. It was another of those 
legal loopholes: the courts wouldn't let the schools track us with arphids, but they 
could track library books, and use the school records to tell them who was likely to be 
carrying which library book.

I had a little Faraday pouch in my bag -- these are little wallets lined with a mesh of 
copper wires that effectively block radio energy, silencing arphids. But the pouches 
were made for neutralizing ID cards and toll-booth transponders, not books like --

"Introduction to Physics?" I groaned. The book was the size of a dictionary.


## Chapter 2

*This chapter is dedicated to Amazon.com, the largest Internet bookseller in the world. Amazon is *amazing* -- a "store" where you can get practically any book* 
*ever published (along with practically everything else, from laptops to cheese-graters), where they've elevated recommendations to a high art, where they allow* 
*customers to directly communicate with each other, where they are constantly inventing new and better ways of connecting books with readers. Amazon has always* 
*treated me like gold -- the founder, Jeff Bezos, even posted a reader-review for my first novel! -- and I shop there like crazy (looking at my spreadsheets, it* 
*appears that I buy something from Amazon approximately every six days). Amazon's in the process of reinventing what it means to be a bookstore in the* 
*twenty-first century and I can't think of a better group of people to be facing down that thorny set of problems.*

"I'm thinking of majoring in physics when I go to Berkeley," Darryl said. His dad taught 
at the University of California at Berkeley, which meant he'd get free tuition when he 
went. And there'd never been any question in Darryl's household about whether he'd go.

"Fine, but couldn't you research it online?"

"My dad said I should read it. Besides, I didn't plan on committing any crimes today."

"Skipping school isn't a crime. It's an infraction. They're totally different."

"What are we going to do, Marcus?"

"Well, I can't hide it, so I'm going to have to nuke it." Killing arphids is a dark art. 
No merchant wants malicious customers going for a walk around the shop-floor and leaving 
behind a bunch of lobotomized merchandise that is missing its invisible bar-code, so the 
manufacturers have refused to implement a "kill signal" that you can radio to an arphid 
to get it to switch off. You can reprogram arphids with the right box, but I hate doing 
that to library books. It's not exactly tearing pages out of a book, but it's still bad, 
since a book with a reprogrammed arphid can't be shelved and can't be found. It just 
becomes a needle in a haystack.

That left me with only one option: nuking the thing. Literally. 30 seconds in a 
microwave will do in pretty much every arphid on the market. And because the arphid 
wouldn't answer at all when D checked it back in at the library, they'd just print a 
fresh one for it and recode it with the book's catalog info, and it would end up clean 
and neat back on its shelf.

All we needed was a microwave.

"Give it another two minutes and the teacher's lounge will be empty," I said.

Darryl grabbed his book at headed for the door. "Forget it, no way. I'm going to class."

I snagged his elbow and dragged him back. "Come on, D, easy now. It'll be fine."

"The teacher's lounge? Maybe you weren't listening, Marcus. If I get busted just once more, I am expelled. You hear that? Expelled."

"You won't get caught," I said. The one place a teacher wouldn't be after this period 
was the lounge. "We'll go in the back way." The lounge had a little kitchenette off to 
one side, with its own entrance for teachers who just wanted to pop in and get a cup of 
joe. The microwave -- which always reeked of popcorn and spilled soup -- was right in 
there, on top of the miniature fridge.

Darryl groaned. I thought fast. "Look, the bell's already rung. If you go to study hall 
now, you'll get a late-slip. Better not to show at all at this point. I can infiltrate 
and exfiltrate any room on this campus, D. You've seen me do it. I'll keep you safe, bro."

He groaned again. That was one of Darryl's tells: once he starts groaning, he's ready to 
give in.

"Let's roll," I said, and we took off.

It was flawless. We skirted the classrooms, took the back stairs into the basement, and 
came up the front stairs right in front of the teachers' lounge. Not a sound came from 
the door, and I quietly turned the knob and dragged Darryl in before silently closing 
the door.

The book just barely fit in the microwave, which was looking even less sanitary than it 
had the last time I'd popped in here to use it. I conscientiously wrapped it in paper 
towels before I set it down. "Man, teachers are pigs," I hissed. Darryl, white faced and 
tense, said nothing.

The arphid died in a shower of sparks, which was really quite lovely (though not nearly 
as pretty as the effect you get when you nuke a frozen grape, which has to be seen to be 
believed).


Now, to exfiltrate the campus in perfect anonymity and make our escape.

Darryl opened the door and began to move out, me on his heels. A second later, he was 
standing on my toes, elbows jammed into my chest, as he tried to back-pedal into the 
closet-sized kitchen we'd just left.

"Get back," he whispered urgently. "Quick -- it's Charles!"

Charles Walker and I don't get along. We're in the same grade, and we've known each 
other as long as I've known Darryl, but that's where the resemblance ends. Charles has 
always been big for his age, and now that he's playing football and on the juice, he's 
even bigger. He's got anger management problems -- I lost a milk-tooth to him in the 
third grade -- and he's managed to keep from getting in trouble over them by becoming 
the most active snitch in school.

It's a bad combination, a bully who also snitches, taking great pleasure in going to the 
teachers with whatever infractions he's found. Benson loved Charles. Charles liked to 
let on that he had some kind of unspecified bladder problem, which gave him a ready-made 
excuse to prowl the hallways at Chavez, looking for people to fink on.

The last time Charles had caught some dirt on me, it had ended with me giving up 
LARPing. I had no intention of being caught by him again.

"What's he doing?"

"He's coming this way is what he's doing," Darryl said. He was shaking.

"OK," I said. "OK, time for emergency countermeasures." I got my phone out. I'd planned this well in advance. Charles would never get me again. I emailed my server at home, and it got into motion.

A few seconds later, Charles's phone spazzed out spectacularly. I'd had tens of 
thousands of simultaneous random calls and text messages sent to it, causing every chirp 
and ring it had to go off and keep on going off. The attack was accomplished by means of 
a botnet, and for that I felt bad, but it was in the service of a good cause.

Botnets are where infected computers spend their afterlives. When you get a worm or a 
virus, your computer sends a message to a chat channel on IRC -- the Internet Relay 
Chat. That message tells the botmaster -- the guy who deployed the worm -- that the 
computers are there ready to do his bidding. Botnets are supremely powerful, since they 
can comprise thousands, even hundreds of thousands of computers, scattered all over the 
Internet, connected to juicy high-speed connections and running on fast home PCs. Those 
PCs normally function on behalf of their owners, but when the botmaster calls them, they 
rise like zombies to do his bidding.

There are so many infected PCs on the Internet that the price of hiring an hour or two 
on a botnet has crashed. Mostly these things work for spammers as cheap, distributed 
spambots, filling your mailbox with come-ons for boner-pills or with new viruses that 
can infect you and recruit your machine to join the botnet.

I'd just rented 10 seconds' time on three thousand PCs and had each of them send a text 
message or voice-over-IP call to Charles's phone, whose number I'd extracted from a 
sticky note on Benson's desk during one fateful office-visit.

Needless to say, Charles's phone was not equipped to handle this. First the SMSes filled 
the memory on his phone, causing it to start choking on the routine operations it needed 
to do things like manage the ringer and log all those incoming calls' bogus return 
numbers (did you know that it's really easy to fake the return number on a caller ID? 
There are about fifty ways of doing it -- just google "spoof caller id").

Charles stared at it dumbfounded, and jabbed at it furiously, his thick eyebrows 
knotting and wiggling as he struggled with the demons that had possessed his most 
personal of devices. The plan was working so far, but he wasn't doing what he was 
supposed to be doing next -- he was supposed to go find some place to sit down and try 
to figure out how to get his phone back.

Darryl shook me by the shoulder, and I pulled my eye away from the crack in the door.

"What's he doing?" Darryl whispered.

"I totaled his phone, but he's just staring at it now instead of moving on." It wasn't 
going to be easy to reboot that thing. Once the memory was totally filled, it would have 
a hard time loading the code it needed to delete the bogus messages -- and there was no 
bulk-erase for texts on his phone, so he'd have to manually delete all of the thousands 
of messages.

Darryl shoved me back and stuck his eye up to the door. A moment later, his shoulders 
started to shake. I got scared, thinking he was panicking, but when he pulled back, I 
saw that he was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down his cheeks.

"Galvez just totally busted him for being in the halls during class and for having his 
phone out -- you should have seen her tear into him. She was really enjoying it."

We shook hands solemnly and snuck back out of the corridor, down the stairs, around the 
back, out the door, past the fence and out into the glorious sunlight of afternoon in 
the Mission. Valencia Street had never looked so good. I checked my watch and yelped.

"Let's move! The rest of the gang is meeting us at the cable-cars in twenty minutes!"



Van spotted us first. She was blending in with a group of Korean tourists, which is one 
of her favorite ways of camouflaging herself when she's ditching school. Ever since the 
truancy moblog went live, our world is full of nosy shopkeepers and pecksniffs who take 
it upon themselves to snap our piccies and put them on the net where they can be perused 
by school administrators.

She came out of the crowd and bounded toward us. Darryl has had a thing for Van since 
forever, and she's sweet enough to pretend she doesn't know it. She gave me a hug and 
then moved onto Darryl, giving him a quick sisterly kiss on the cheek that made him go 
red to the tops of his ears.

The two of them made a funny pair: Darryl is a little on the heavy side, though he wears 
it well, and he's got a kind of pink complexion that goes red in the cheeks whenever he 
runs or gets excited. He's been able to grow a beard since we were 14, but thankfully he 
started shaving after a brief period known to our gang as "the Lincoln years." And he's 
tall. Very, very tall. Like basketball player tall.

Meanwhile, Van is half a head shorter than me, and skinny, with straight black hair that 
she wears in crazy, elaborate braids that she researches on the net. She's got pretty 
coppery skin and dark eyes, and she loves big glass rings the size of radishes, which 
click and clack together when she dances.

"Where's Jolu?" she said.

"How are you, Van?" Darryl asked in a choked voice. He always ran a step behind the 
conversation when it came to Van.

"I'm great, D. How's your every little thing?" Oh, she was a bad, bad person. Darryl 
nearly fainted.

Jolu saved him from social disgrace by showing up just then, in an oversize leather 
baseball jacket, sharp sneakers, and a meshback cap advertising our favorite Mexican 
masked wrestler, El Santo Junior. Jolu is Jose Luis Torrez, the completing member of our 
foursome. He went to a super-strict Catholic school in the Outer Richmond, so it wasn't 
easy for him to get out. But he always did: no one exfiltrated like our Jolu. He liked 
his jacket because it hung down low -- which was pretty stylish in parts of the city -- 
and covered up all his Catholic school crap, which was like a bulls-eye for nosy jerks 
with the truancy moblog bookmarked on their phones.

"Who's ready to go?" I asked, once we'd all said hello. I pulled out my phone and showed 
them the map I'd downloaded to it on the BART. "Near as I can work out, we wanna go up 
to the Nikko again, then one block past it to O'Farrell, then left up toward Van Ness. 
Somewhere in there we should find the wireless signal."

Van made a face. "That's a nasty part of the Tenderloin." I couldn't argue with her. 
That part of San Francisco is one of the weird bits -- you go in through the Hilton's 
front entrance and it's all touristy stuff like the cable-car turnaround and family 
restaurants. Go through to the other side and you're in the 'Loin, where every tracked 
out transvestite hooker, hard-case pimp, hissing drug dealer and cracked up homeless 
person in town was concentrated. What they bought and sold, none of us were old enough 
to be a part of (though there were plenty of hookers our age plying their trade in the 
'Loin.)

"Look on the bright side," I said. "The only time you want to go up around there is broad daylight. None of the other players are going to go near it until tomorrow at the earliest. This is what we in the ARG business call a monster head start."

Jolu grinned at me. "You make it sound like a good thing," he said.

"Beats eating uni," I said.

"We going to talk or we going to win?" Van said. After me, she was hands-down the most hardcore player in our group. She took winning very, very seriously.

We struck out, four good friends, on our way to decode a clue, win the game -- and lose everything we cared about, forever.


The physical component of today's clue was a set of GPS coordinates -- there were coordinates for all the major cities where Harajuku Fun Madness was played -- where we'd find a WiFi access-point's signal. That signal was being deliberately jammed by another, nearby WiFi point that was hidden so that it couldn't be spotted by conventional wifinders, little key-fobs that told you when you were within range of someone's open access-point, which you could use for free.

We'd have to track down the location of the "hidden" access point by measuring the strength of the "visible" one, finding the spot where it was most mysteriously weakest. There we'd find another clue -- last time it had been in the special of the day at Anzu, the swanky sushi restaurant in the Nikko hotel in the Tenderloin. The Nikko was owned by Japan Airlines, one of Harajuku Fun Madness's sponsors, and the staff had all made a big fuss over us when we finally tracked down the clue. They'd given us bowls of miso soup and made us try uni, which is sushi made from sea urchin, with the texture of very runny cheese and a smell like very runny dog-droppings. But it tasted really good. Or so Darryl told me. I wasn't going to eat that stuff.

I picked up the WiFi signal with my phone's wifinder about three blocks up O'Farrell, just before Hyde Street, in front of a dodgy "Asian Massage Parlor" with a red blinking CLOSED sign in the window. The network's name was HarajukuFM, so we knew we had the right spot.

"If it's in there, I'm not going," Darryl said.

"You all got your wifinders?" I said.

Darryl and Van had phones with built-in wifinders, while Jolu, being too cool to carry a phone bigger than his pinky finger, had a separate little directional fob.

"OK, fan out and see what we see. You're looking for a sharp drop off in the signal that gets worse the more you move along it."

I took a step backward and ended up standing on someone's toes. A female voice said "oof" and I spun around, worried that some crack-ho was going to stab me for breaking her heels.

Instead, I found myself face to face with another kid my age. She had a shock of bright pink hair and a sharp, rodent-like face, with big sunglasses that were practically air-force goggles. She was dressed in striped tights beneath a black granny dress, with lots of little Japanese decorer toys safety pinned to it -- anime characters, old world leaders, emblems from foreign soda-pop.

She held up a camera and snapped a picture of me and my crew.

"Cheese," she said. "You're on candid snitch-cam."

"No way," I said. "You wouldn't --"

"I will," she said. "I will send this photo to truant watch in thirty seconds unless you four back off from this clue and let me and my friends here run it down. You can come back in one hour and it'll be all yours. I think that's more than fair."

I looked behind her and noticed three other girls in similar garb -- one with blue hair, one with green, and one with purple. "Who are you supposed to be, the Popsicle Squad?"

"We're the team that's going to kick your team's ass at Harajuku Fun Madness," she said. "And I'm the one who's right this second about to upload your photo and get you in so much trouble --"

Behind me I felt Van start forward. Her all-girls school was notorious for its brawls, and I was pretty sure she was ready to knock this chick's block off.


Then the world changed forever.

We felt it first, that sickening lurch of the cement under your feet that every 
Californian knows instinctively -- earthquake. My first inclination, as always, was to 
get away: "when in trouble or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout." But the fact 
was, we were already in the safest place we could be, not in a building that could fall 
in on us, not out toward the middle of the road where bits of falling cornice could 
brain us.

Earthquakes are eerily quiet -- at first, anyway -- but this wasn't quiet. This was 
loud, an incredible roaring sound that was louder than anything I'd ever heard before. 
The sound was so punishing it drove me to my knees, and I wasn't the only one. Darryl 
shook my arm and pointed over the buildings and we saw it then: a huge black cloud 
rising from the northeast, from the direction of the Bay.

There was another rumble, and the cloud of smoke spread out, that spreading black shape 
we'd all grown up seeing in movies. Someone had just blown up something, in a big way.

There were more rumbles and more tremors. Heads appeared at windows up and down the 
street. We all looked at the mushroom cloud in silence.

Then the sirens started.

I'd heard sirens like these before -- they test the civil defense sirens at noon on 
Tuesdays. But I'd only heard them go off unscheduled in old war movies and video games, 
the kind where someone is bombing someone else from above. Air raid sirens. The wooooooo 
sound made it all less real.

"Report to shelters immediately." It was like the voice of God, coming from all places 
at once. There were speakers on some of the electric poles, something I'd never noticed 
before, and they'd all switched on at once.

"Report to shelters immediately." Shelters? We looked at each other in confusion. What 
shelters? The cloud was rising steadily, spreading out. Was it nuclear? Were we 
breathing in our last breaths?

The girl with the pink hair grabbed her friends and they tore ass downhill, back toward 
the BART station and the foot of the hills.

"REPORT TO SHELTERS IMMEDIATELY." There was screaming now, and a lot of running around. 
Tourists -- you can always spot the tourists, they're the ones who think CALIFORNIA = 
WARM and spend their San Francisco holidays freezing in shorts and t-shirts -- scattered 
in every direction.

"We should go!" Darryl hollered in my ear, just barely audible over the shrieking of the 
sirens, which had been joined by traditional police sirens. A dozen SFPD cruisers 
screamed past us.

"REPORT TO SHELTERS IMMEDIATELY."

"Down to the BART station," I hollered. My friends nodded. We closed ranks and began to 
move quickly downhill.
