My agent, Russell Galen (and his sub-agent Danny Baror) did an amazing job
of pre-selling rights to Little Brother in many languages and formats.
Here's the list as of today (May 4, 2008). I'll be updating it as more
editions are sold, so feel free to grab another copy of this file
(http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download) if there's an edition you're
hoping to see, or see http://craphound.com/littlebrother/buy/ for links to
buy all the currently shipping editions.

A condition of my deal with Random House is that they're not allowed to
release this on services that use "DRM" (Digital Rights Management)
systems intended to control use and copying. That means that you won't
find this book on Audible or iTunes, because Audible refuses to sell books
without DRM (even if the author and publisher don't want DRM), and iTunes
only carries Audible audiobooks. However, you can buy the MP3 file direct
from RandomHouse or many other fine etailers, or through this link My
foreign rights agent, Danny Baror, has presold a number of foreign
editions:

  * Greece: Pataki 
  * Russia: AST Publishing 
  * France: Universe Poche 
  * Norway: Det Norske Samlaget 

No publication dates yet for these, but I'll keep updating this file as
more information is available. You can also subscribe to my mailing list
for more info.
