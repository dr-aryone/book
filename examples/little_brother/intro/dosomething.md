This book is meant to be something you do, not just something you read.
The technology in this book is either real or nearly real. You can build
a lot of it. You can share it and remix it (see THE COPYRIGHT THING,
below). You can use the ideas to spark important discussions with your
friends and family. You can use those ideas to defeat censorship and get
onto the free Internet, even if your government, employer or school
doesn't want you to.

Making stuff: The folks at Instructables have put up some killer HOWTOs
for building the technology in this book. It's easy and incredibly fun.
There's nothing so rewarding in this world as making stuff, especially
stuff that makes you more free:

Discussions: There's an [educator's manual for this book](http://www.tor-forge.com/static/Little_Brother_Readers_Guide.pdf) that my publisher,
Tor, has put together that has tons of ideas for classroom, reading group
and home discussions of the ideas in it.

Defeat censorship: The afterword for this book has lots of resources for
increasing your online freedom, blocking the snoops and evading the
censorware blocks. The more people who know about this stuff, the better.

Your stories: I'm collecting stories of people who've used technology to
get the upper hand when confronted with abusive authority. I'm going to be
including the best of these in a special afterword to the UK edition (see
below) of the book, and I'll be putting them online as well. Send me your
stories at [doctorow@craphound.com, with the subject line "Abuses of
Authority"](doctorow@craphound.com&subject=Abuses of Authority).
