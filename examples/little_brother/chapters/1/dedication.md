This chapter is dedicated to BakkaPhoenix Books in Toronto, Canada. Bakka is the oldest
science fiction bookstore in the world, and it made me the mutant I am today. I wandered 
in for the first time around the age of 10 and asked for some recommendations. Tanya Huff 
(yes, the Tanya Huff, but she wasn't a famous writer back then!) took me back into the 
used section and pressed a copy of H. Beam Piper's "Little Fuzzy" into my hands, and 
changed my life forever. By the time I was 18, I was working at Bakka -- I took over from 
Tanya when she retired to write full time -- and I learned life-long lessons about how 
and why people buy books. I think every writer should work at a bookstore (and plenty of 
writers have worked at Bakka over the years! For the 30th anniversary of the store, they 
put together an anthology of stories by Bakka writers that included work by Michelle 
Sagara (AKA Michelle West), Tanya Huff, Nalo Hopkinson, Tara Tallan --and me!)
