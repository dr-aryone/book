I wasn't always into ARGing. I have a dark secret: I used to be a LARPer. LARPing is 
Live Action Role Playing, and it's just about what it sounds like: running around in 
costume, talking in a funny accent, pretending to be a super-spy or a vampire or a 
medieval knight. It's like Capture the Flag in monster-drag, with a bit of Drama Club 
thrown in, and the best games were the ones we played in Scout Camps out of town in 
Sonoma or down on the Peninsula. Those three-day epics could get pretty hairy, with 
all-day hikes, epic battles with foam-and-bamboo swords, casting spells by throwing 
beanbags and shouting "Fireball!" and so on. Good fun, if a little goofy. Not nearly as 
geeky as talking about what your elf planned on doing as you sat around a table loaded 
with Diet Coke cans and painted miniatures, and more physically active than going into a 
mouse-coma in front of a massively multiplayer game at home.

The thing that got me into trouble were the mini-games in the hotels. Whenever a science 
fiction convention came to town, some LARPer would convince them to let us run a couple 
of six-hour mini-games at the con, piggybacking on their rental of the space. Having a 
bunch of enthusiastic kids running around in costume lent color to the event, and we got 
to have a ball among people even more socially deviant than us.

The problem with hotels is that they have a lot of non-gamers in them, too -- and not 
just sci-fi people. Normal people. From states that begin and end with vowels. On 
holidays.

And sometimes those people misunderstand the nature of a game.

Let's just leave it at that, OK?
