Class ended in ten minutes, and that didn't leave me with much time to prepare. The 
first order of business were those pesky gait-recognition cameras. Like I said, they'd 
started out as face-recognition cameras, but those had been ruled unconstitutional. As 
far as I know, no court has yet determined whether these gait-cams are any more legal, 
but until they do, we're stuck with them.
