I got back to class and sat down again, Ms Galvez warmly welcoming me back. I unpacked 
the school's standard-issue machine and got back into classroom mode. The SchoolBooks 
were the snitchiest technology of them all, logging every keystroke, watching all the 
network traffic for suspicious keywords, counting every click, keeping track of every 
fleeting thought you put out over the net. We'd gotten them in my junior year, and it 
only took a couple months for the shininess to wear off. Once people figured out that 
these "free" laptops worked for the man -- and showed a never-ending parade of obnoxious 
ads to boot -- they suddenly started to feel very heavy and burdensome.

Cracking my SchoolBook had been easy. The crack was online within a month of the machine 
showing up, and there was nothing to it -- just download a DVD image, burn it, stick it 
in the SchoolBook, and boot it while holding down a bunch of different keys at the same 
time. The DVD did the rest, installing a whole bunch of hidden programs on the machine, 
programs that would stay hidden even when the Board of Ed did its daily remote integrity 
checks of the machines. Every now and again I had to get an update for the software to 
get around the Board's latest tests, but it was a small price to pay to get a little 
control over the box.

I fired up IMParanoid, the secret instant messenger that I used when I wanted to have an 
off-the-record discussion right in the middle of class. Darryl was already logged in.

> The game's afoot! Something big is going down with Harajuku Fun Madness, dude. You in?
> No. Freaking. Way. If I get caught ditching a third time, I'm expelled. Man, you know 
that. We'll go after school.
> You've got lunch and then study-hall, right? That's two hours. Plenty of time to run 
down this clue and get back before anyone misses us. I'll get the whole team out.

Harajuku Fun Madness is the best game ever made. I know I already said that, but it 
bears repeating. It's an ARG, an Alternate Reality Game, and the story goes that a gang 
of Japanese fashion-teens discovered a miraculous healing gem at the temple in Harajuku, 
which is basically where cool Japanese teenagers invented every major subculture for the 
past ten years. They're being hunted by evil monks, the Yakuza (AKA the Japanese mafia), 
aliens, tax-inspectors, parents, and a rogue artificial intelligence. They slip the 
players coded messages that we have to decode and use to track down clues that lead to 
more coded messages and more clues.

Imagine the best afternoon you've ever spent prowling the streets of a city, checking 
out all the weird people, funny hand-bills, street-maniacs, and funky shops. Now add a 
scavenger hunt to that, one that requires you to research crazy old films and songs and 
teen culture from around the world and across time and space. And it's a competition, 
with the winning team of four taking a grand prize of ten days in Tokyo, chilling on 
Harajuku bridge, geeking out in Akihabara, and taking home all the Astro Boy merchandise 
you can eat. Except that he's called "Atom Boy" in Japan.

That's Harajuku Fun Madness, and once you've solved a puzzle or two, you'll never look 
back.

> No man, just no. NO. Don't even ask.
> I need you D. You're the best I've got. I swear I'll get us in and out without anyone 
knowing it. You know I can do that, right?
> I know you can do it
> So you're in?
> Hell no
> Come on, Darryl. You're not going to your deathbed wishing you'd spent more study 
periods sitting in school
> I'm not going to go to my deathbed wishing I'd spent more time playing ARGs either
> Yeah but don't you think you might go to your death-bed wishing you'd spent more time 
with Vanessa Pak?
Van was part of my team. She went to a private girl's school in the East Bay, but I knew 
she'd ditch to come out and run the mission with me. Darryl has had a crush on her 
literally for years -- even before puberty endowed her with many lavish gifts. Darryl 
had fallen in love with her mind. Sad, really.

> You suck
> You're coming?
He looked at me and shook his head. Then he nodded. I winked at him and set to work 
getting in touch with the rest of my team.
