*This chapter is dedicated to Amazon.com, the largest Internet bookseller in the world. Amazon is *amazing* -- a "store" where you can get practically any book* 
*ever published (along with practically everything else, from laptops to cheese-graters), where they've elevated recommendations to a high art, where they allow* 
*customers to directly communicate with each other, where they are constantly inventing new and better ways of connecting books with readers. Amazon has always* 
*treated me like gold -- the founder, Jeff Bezos, even posted a reader-review for my first novel! -- and I shop there like crazy (looking at my spreadsheets, it* 
*appears that I buy something from Amazon approximately every six days). Amazon's in the process of reinventing what it means to be a bookstore in the* 
*twenty-first century and I can't think of a better group of people to be facing down that thorny set of problems.*
